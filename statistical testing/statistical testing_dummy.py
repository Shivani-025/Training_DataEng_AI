1-SAMPLE T-TEST

Formulating Hypotheses:
•  H0 : μ = 300
•  H1 : μ ≠ 300

The t-test checks whether the sample mean is significantly 
different from the population mean. 
Since the sample mean is very close to 300, the p-value will be higher,
indicating insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis 
at the 0.05 significance level.
